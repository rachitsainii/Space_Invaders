# Space_Invaders
The classic arcade game from 1978 re-created. The player has to destroy the alien spaceships coming towards his spaceship, by firing missiles towards them. As the player destroys each alien ship his score increases by 10 points. The player/s will also be able to move their spaceships left of right to effectively fire missiles at enemy ships. Below is a Screenshot of the game giving a look into the UI.
